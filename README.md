# D1 Landing (Sketch â†’ Code)
Run:
- Open `index.html` directly, or
- `python -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000`

Edit:
- Replace images in `assets/images/` with exports from Sketch.
- Styles live in `dist/styles.css` (precompiled). SCSS sources are in `/scss/` if you want to recompile.
